          <p className=' contact-p' style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Becoming Indiaâ€™s well-known fashion destination is not an easy feat. Sincere efforts, digital enhancements and a team of dedicated personnel with an equally loyal customer base have made Smart Store the online platform that it is today. The original B2B venture for personalized gifts was conceived in 2015 but transitioned into a full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of just a few years. By 2017, Smart Store had introduced 100+ Indian and international brands to its platform, and this has only grown in number each passing year.
